Italy's daily Civil Protection press conference live now at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g94qgpafbdI - I will take some notes. A press conference by the PM may follow on new measures adopted.
(Borrelli) I am here with Roberto Bernabei, the president of Italia Longeva association.
Today we have a total of 98206 currently positive, +1396 since yesterday.
We have 3497 people in ICU, -108, and 28242 hospitalized, -157.
Most people are self-isolating, 66534 (68%).
New deaths are +570.
As to the general trend, +3951 new positive, 147567 total including everyone who was ever positive.
We have 16419 volunteers.
Professor, would you like to speak breafly? As you know there is also the PM's press conference today, so we'll have no questions today.
(Bernabei) What the PM says will be very important, so I will just give you a thought on data provided by the ISS: comorbidities play an important role in this epidemic, as 63% of deceased had 3+ of them. If you are in such a situation you must be extremely careful, but on the other hand, and this is something new about this pathology, all kinds of health structures on our territory must be enhanced.
It's obvious that people with multiple pathology do not just benefit from being hospitalized in an acute phase, but also from being helped at home or in nursing home or other structures.
A good evening to everybody.

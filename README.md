**First and foremost**: if this is not in your country yet, it *is* coming to your country. Soon. Sooner than you think. Sooner than authorities think. We can even say that out loud in public now, after the WHO finally decided to declare it a pandemic. Please [read this article](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) and understand what is happening, and about to happen again.

It's not a joke, and let's get one thing straight: it's definitely **NOT** a flu. [It is not even very bad flu](https://framapic.org/nnKQN9siF9jK/8FWSaX1fbDPY.png):

* it is a completely different type of virus (the [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) dubbed [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), while influenza is caused by an [influenzavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae))
* it has a much longer incubation time, during which evidence is starting to accumulate that it can very well be transmissible
* it may be [more easily transmissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) than even some of the very bad flus
* the picture for mortality rates is not yet completely clear but rates for the at-risk population appear to be significantly higher than even some of the worst flus
* the mortality profile is very different from even terrible flus like the [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), with the sick and elderly being disproportionately at risk
* many people (roughly 15% to 30%) require hospitalization, putting strain on resources that risks driving up COVID-19 and all-cause mortality during critical shortages
* about 5% to 10% develop a very serious *viral* pneumonia, while people developing pneumonia from influenza usually develop a more treatable *bacterial* pneumonia
* there is currently no vaccine, cure or any treatment aside from assisting people severely ill with breathing and other needs
* we have no immune defenses against it currently, while we have varying degree of immune response to influenza, depending on the strain we're seeing

But it does tend to present with fever, joint aches and a dry cough. Right, those are similar symptoms to flu. They are also symptoms of a myriad other diseases too, so there is no reason in particular to compare it with flu. Bottom line: it has nothing to do with the flu except for having some similar symptoms just like most other viral diseases.

# Do I have it?

Short answer: we don't know.

A very important thing about this disease is having tests, because this disease cannot be [diagnosed clinically](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clinical_diagnosis), meaning that even a doctor won't be able to tell you whether or not you have it just based on looking at you and checking out your symptoms.

This is because COVID-19 can be considered a [flu-like illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness): this doesn't mean it has actually anything to do with flu (see the [relevant section]()!), but merely that it causes symptoms that are extremely generic and common to many illnesses, such as fever and cough.

So if you have some symptoms, unfortunately, it needs to be clear that you *cannot* determine wether or not it's COVID-19 on your own, or even with others' help, or even with a doctor's help, without a test. On the other hand, there are signs and symptoms that indicate you should probably *call* a doctor (don't go to one, call them first!) on the suspicion you may have COVID-19, or simply because they are concerning enough.

You can read and follow [this self-triage tool](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/20/self-triage-tool-covid-19/) to determine whether your symptoms warrant consulting medical services.

There is mixed advice on the use of masks by the general public, and the advice from political authorities appears to be changing in various parts of the world dependingon the availability of masks and the state of the pandemic.
